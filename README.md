Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data using Data Analytics

Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. It also focus on applying data patterns towards effective decision making. It can be valuable in areas rich with recorded information; analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics,computer programming and operational research to quantify performance.One type of data that’s easier to find on the net is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters such as pressure, temperature, humidity, wind_speed, visibility, etc
Our goal is to transform the raw data into information and then convert that information into knowledge.We will be performing some basic tasks to perform our analysis such as data cleaning ,data normalizing ,testing the hypothesis and finally inferring certain information.
Today our aim will be to perform Data Analysis on a Meteorological Dataset which you can find here.

The Dataset has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006–04–01 to 2016–09–09 . It corresponds to Finland, a country in the Northern Europe.
The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming.”
The H0 means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.
